# Project-trojan-horse
Trojan Horse Command & Control System
This project presents an advanced Trojan Horse framework developed in Python, integrated with a web-based command-and-control (C2) backend built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. It is intended for educational and research purposes in the cybersecurity domain to understand malware operation, remote command execution, and stealth communication techniques.

Features
Python-based Trojan embedded within a game application to execute hidden background processes.

Real-time command retrieval from a secure web server via a designated HTML element.

Dynamic command execution on the infected machine with results sent back to the server database.

Web backend dashboard to issue commands and monitor results.

Use of standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL for the backend.

Command and control communication designed to mask the true source IP, effectively tracing only the userâ€™s IP.

Demonstration
A video demonstration is included illustrating remote ping commands executed on targets such as "youtube.com" and a non-existent IP "10.10.10.10." This shows the backend receiving live results and dynamic command updates via the web interface.
